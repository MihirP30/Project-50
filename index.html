            <h4>
                Origami was initially part of traditional Japanese culture. It got its name from the Japanese words "Oru'' meaning "Fold" and "Kami" meaning paper. Starting from the year 1797, humans have been learning and teaching origami and by 1845, it was an internationally practiced art. Since then there have been over 150 international origami competitions resulting in countless origami artworks all around the world. Later on it would come to be known as a surprisingly effective stress buster and has even been proved to help with concentration and learning capacity.
